More than ever before, critical discoveries are often made in strong collaborations of several teams of researchers from related fields. While interdisciplinary research presents an opportunity for impactful discoveries and greater outputs; it also presents unique challenges, particularly when managing data among several disciplines. In the past, the projects you’ve worked on may have been individual, or as part of a team of researchers from within your domain - where shared expectations, skills, and communications allowed for effective data management. However, for interdisciplinary and highly collaborative research, the challenges in working within several domains presents challenges and considerations beyond the usual scope of data management you may be used to. This introductory guide will serve as a guide for your group to begin discussion on how best to manage data in your group’s next IHCR project. Several important points for consideration are presented, divided into sections based on when in the project these points are most important to consider. For each topic, critical questions to consider are presented to guide the discussions both within internal domain specific teams, and the larger interdisciplinary research group as a whole. Relevant to each section are linked from each topics page. While your domain specific team may be working largely independent of other contributors, many of the topics discussed will still be critical to maintaining communications across the interdisciplinary group, and ensuring your work can be properly preserved. This introductory guide assumes the reader has prior rudimentary knowledge of data management practices for an domain specific project; however resources are provided for all topics discussed to learn the specifics of data management. Throughout this guide, we define the group as the broadest set of members in this interdisciplinary/highly collaborative research project, a team as a subgroup of members within one discipline or part of the collaborative project, and a member as an individual researcher who is part of both the group and one (or more) teams. This guide exists as part of a larger Interdisciplinary and Highly Collaborative Research Data Management grant by Indiana State University, the University of Colorado Boulder, and the Virginia Polytechnic Institute - which encourages and provides guidance in collection, curation, archival, and management of IHCR data.

Good communication &amp; project planning from the very beginning is critical for an interdisciplinary &amp; highly collaborative project - as several teams will be bringing their own workflows &amp; communication styles to the table. For interdisciplinary projects in particular, each team member may bring their own assumptions regarding how a project should be managed, and assumptions made that may not align with the other team members. Without clearly defined goals &amp; expectations, new pieces &amp; components could be added to the project that completely exceed the original workload set in initial meetings. It can be difficult to know when working with other disciplines if a new component is necessary &amp; expected - or if it’s an extraneous addition. It may also be possible that certain disciplines expect different outputs, and have differing expectations of what particular outputs mean (i.e publication). All of these concerns can lead to a chaotic working environment &amp; massively slow down the project as communications break down. Questions to Consider What are the expected final outputs of this project? Where and when will they be published? What will you need to create for the project to be considered successful? How will you share these creations with others? What are the project deadlines? What does each team contribute to the expected outputs? Are particular outputs created solely by one team, or as a collaborative effort of more than one team? When are your team’s deadlines? When are the group’s deadlines? How will communications be set up between team members? How will files be shared? How frequently will group members need to communicate? (e.g. monthly updates, daily communications) What tools best suit your communication needs? (e.g. Google Suite, Slack, Teams) Additional Resources IHCR Workflow project charter 1.2 Sharing among the group after the project Sharing among the group after the project At first glance, this may seem like a component that could be saved for the end of a project. However, planning and forethought about who will be in charge of which components of project data is vital to the project’s eventual success. It may seem simple, but particularly in highly collaborative projects, it is easy for data to be lost, not obtained, or left out of discussion or analysis because data was not properly shared between relevant researchers. This is most salient in an interdisciplinary research group - where several team members may not even be aware that they are missing a critical piece of data generated by their collaborators from different domains. If this happens, inaccurate conclusions could be made, the working timeline extended, and the entire project risks creating useless outputs. Questions to Consider What data is each group collecting? What data needs to be shared? How and when will data be shared? What file types will be used to store your data? Will other group members be able to access them with appropriate permissions? What will you use to make files available to other group members? Will your communications tool work as a file sharing network? Will multiple people need to work on one file? If so, how will this happen and what software will you use? How will the data be explained? How much does each group member have to understand the whole dataset? What explanation or context would you need to give a particular group member so they can understand the data shared and do something with it? Additional Resources IHCR Information storage and organization IHCR Workflow preservation platform data 1.3 Choosing from a variety of tools/methods Introduction Many researchers have domain specific tools to accomplish tasks within an IHCR project. In addition, there are a variety of data management tools/software, and it is highly likely that an interdisciplinary team will have varying skill sets &amp; comfortability with these tools. Even something as simple as data in spreadsheet applications can become challenging to manage and analyze if half the team is using Microsoft Excel, and the other half Google Sheets. It may be the case that different interdisciplinary representatives can use what tools work best for them, or it may be the case that unity of tools &amp; methods used is of the utmost importance. Regardless of which one the project calls for, being clear on which tools are being used will ensure that difficulties in unifying &amp; working with data are mitigated. While many tools are useful, and could speed up the project, careful consideration should be taken as to factors such as how long it would take to learn a new tool, and its availability to everyone on the project. If you use a tool no one has time to learn, it may be useful, but unusable. Be wary of complicated solutions that require much technical know-how, they are often not the best way to accomplish a task. In addition, if new tools are not established &amp; communicated , you may get incompatible files &amp; workflows that will impede collaboration and slow progress. Questions to Consider Which tools will each team have to use? What are the costs of these tools? How much time will it take to learn these tools? What software does your team use to collect, analyze, and visualize data? Do other teams know how to use this software and will they need to learn? How much time will it take to move data from one tool to another? Will tools be used by multiple teams/disciplines, and if so what is the learning curve for their usage? Do other group members need to learn and understand your software? Is there a cost to access the software?

Introduction Effective data storage is a critical component for any successful research project, and its importance is only magnified with the volume &amp; diversity of data that is typically involved with an interdisciplinary &amp; highly collaborative research project. Researcher choices about data storage, including where it can be stored, who has access, and in what format, depend on discipline and available resources. The group should lay out which pieces of data need to be readily shared &amp; accessible by group members &amp; collaborators - and find a platform that can allow for such sharing if it is needed. Additional training, secure storage, and/or access restrictions may be required for data containing sensitive information. Talk to the domain experts on each piece of data to be collected on your team, and consult with institutional support teams (e.g. IRB, research data services, IT) as needed. If proper data storage is not discussed or considered, this can spiral into several competing versions of the datasets. Not only does this slow data analysis, but can lead to inaccurate analysis. Questions to Consider Is this data sensitive? Do you need approval for data security plans from another academic unit (e.g. IRB, Export Control, Research Compliance)? What servers will the data be stored on? Does the data need to be stored in a secure location? Does your data contain information on human research participants? Does it contain classified information or is it associated with national security research? Is your data reasonably identifiable to certain individuals? Based on the data and other openly available information could you guess who individuals are? Does everyone on the project need access to a particular dataset? Only some of them? Which team members will have access to which files? Do you need special authorization or training to use a dataset, such as the (CITI) Human Subjects Research Basic Course or special human subject training? Will it be overwhelming if every group member has access to all of the data? Can data access be compartmentalized for each team or members? What data needs to be shared among all group members?

While often these can be solved relatively easily in a domain isolated project, for an interdisciplinary and highly collaborative project, these problems can quickly cascade into large problems that can lead to delays in answering research questions. Examples include not properly updating shared data storage to reflect changes to the research process, storing critical files only on local devices, and not properly documenting data changes. It is also important for the researchers to consider if their storage plans are working well or need to be modified. Keeping data messy, or having no central plan for data management will inevitably lead to confusion, difficulty in utilizing programmatic tools (even basic manipulation in excel), and will lead to frustration in accomplishing interdisciplinary This could also lead to competing versions of different datasets, which can lead to inaccuracies in final outputs. Spreadsheets are not a substitution for a lab notebook. Questions to Consider Will multiple people be working on the same dataset? Are procedures established for how such datasets will be collected, documented, stored, and otherwise managed? Are datasets modified or combined after being shared with and used by group members? How will these modifications be tracked? How will the datasets be updated? Where is the “master” version of the data? How will team members be notified of dataset changes? Will backups of older versions of the dataset be maintained? How will the data be backed up? Who is responsible for data backups? If the dataset is changed, what is the main version of the dataset? Will people need to reference the original version? Additional Resources IHCR Workflow Information storage and organization 2.2 Modifying Tools &amp; Methods Introduction Whether it is the addition of a new team member, shifting resources, or simply a method being not as effective as previously thought, change in research mid-project is common. For an interdisciplinary and highly collaborative research project,these issues may arise all at once with every member of the team, or it may be the case that certain domains are encountering issues where others may not. When modifying a tool or method mid-project, it is important that everyone on the team be aware, and fully understand the implications of the change. Consider how the change may affect every member of the team. If a tool becomes critical, but is difficult to use due to it being heavily relied on knowledge of a particular discipline, it can greatly affect the team’s effort if something happens to that particular participant. In addition, as team members come and go, it may be that the expert in the tool leaves without finding a suitable replacement, which could potentially massively impede progress and delay outputs. Questions to Consider What necessitated a change in tools/methods? Did the tools not work as expected? Are the current tools working for you? Are there methods of communication that unreasonably slow the process? Does the entire team need to modify their methods, or only some of them? Are all relevant team members informed of the change? How will changes in tools or methods during the project be recorded such that data workflows are trackable in the future? Is there relevant documentation or manuals that can be used as references for previously used tools or methods? Additional Resources IHCR Quantitative Data Processing 2.3 Responsibly Leaving or Joining an Ongoing Project Introduction It is highly unlikely that each team member will all be on the same timeline for when they will be graduating, or continuing to be a part of the project. It is always frustrating when someone leaves a project with critical knowledge &amp; data, particularly if they cannot be easily reached after leaving. And IHCR team members are more likely to have knowledge or create data that the other members do not fully understand. If you are the person leaving the project there are many things you can do to ensure the project continues to run smoothly after your departure, and with minimal need for the team to contact you in the future. If proper steps are not taken, it is very easy for ex-projects members to be unreachable, and for them to remove critical pieces of data/project work from their personal devices. You don’t want a project you left two years ago calling about a particularly important file that you deleted several months prior. Questions to Consider Who will take over your role in the project? Does someone need to take over your role? How does your role contribute to the IHCR project? Consider what expertise critical to your role; does anyone else have this expertise? How will you transfer this expertise to others? Can your team members understand the data you were responsible for? Have you left detailed metadata for them to understand this data? Could someone easily understand relevant files and documentation you were managing on your personal computer? Will you be available to call in the event of an emergency? How prompt can they expect you to be? What level of involvement will you accept after walking away? In the event of an emergency, would anyone be able to recover and understand your data &amp; work?

The volume and diversity of data in an interdisciplinary project can make this challenging; particularly when some of that data may lack the originating context, or potentially contain sensitive, personal data. As your project is being completed, the team must come together to decide and execute previous plans for where the data will be shared, how long it can be stored there for, and who will be responsible for maintaining the data should services change. An important consideration is that many data sharing and preservation options are not free. If a plan is not put in place for long term data archiving and sharing, it’s very easy for critical files to end up lost in email chains, or stored on someone’s personal computer. If you’re audited for your project, or need to access these files again - recovery can be a slow and difficult process. Without proper discussion on data security, a spreadsheet containing sensitive data could easily be sent over email to an outside, unencrypted email - violating federal privacy laws. In addition, many online tools go out of service, and if no one is there to recover the data, then the data can easily be lost. Questions to Consider Where will the data be shared publicly long term? Will all project data be shared in one repository, or will it be distributed across multiple disciplinary repositories? Is the entire group’s data going to be deposited long-term in one place? Is it advantageous for the data to be spread out among multiple online locations? Will your public data sharing plans cost money? How long can you expect the data to be available in those systems? In finding an appropriate repository for data deposit and public sharing, have you considered these important repository capabilities Are there data sensitivity issues? What justifications might you have to not share your data publicly? Could you share part of your data if you took more actions on it, e.g. deidentified human participants data? Who could you talk to find out more regarding policies and procedures on sharing sensitive data? Who will be the primary contact for the data? Who will be responsible if errors are found within the data, or if a potential user has technical questions? Or if a user is seeking to collaborate on their use of the data? Additional Resources IHCR Data Catalog IHCR Workflow preservation platform data 3.2 Creating Reusable Data Introduction Despite the data being as open as possible, many data issues can still arise preventing it from being reusable. A lack of a well-written data dictionary, numeric column headers, and explanation for data sources can make the data practically unusable to someone trying to build on your work. In interdisciplinary projects, where the diversity of data &amp; collection tools can make it even more difficult for an outsider to ascertain how data was collected, what each data table means, and how it could be used for their own purpose. While this is more work in the short term, documenting data collection methods, leaving extensive data dictionaries, organizing the data in an understandable &amp; readable way, ect.; ultimately ensures that your data can be useful long into the future by both the creators of the data and others in the future. If your spreadsheet contains columns/rows without identifiers, are connected in ways that aren’t documented, or has so many files that it would be impossible for someone not on the project to understand - then it will be more difficult for future researchers looking to use the data. Your data should always carry supplemental information with explanation, particularly when that data is going to be in long term archiving at a project’s end. Questions to Consider How easy is it for an outsider to interpret your data? What accompanying explanation will it require? Does the dataset link to that explanation? Would an outsider be able to understand your data by looking at the raw or analyzed files? Would they be able to open, interpret and visualize them? Would the data require special software to access? Is the data searchable? If so, through which databases? How would someone find your data?
